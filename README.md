# Continuous Control Long MI EEG Investigation in Active BCI Systems
**Note**: The detailed explanations and protocols will be shared upon the acceptance and publication of the associated research paper.

## Overview
This project investigates the use of Motor Imagery (MI) Electroencephalography (EEG) signals in building an optimal MI-BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) system. Data was collected from 15 healthy participants performing Motor Imagery tasks (Hand, Feet, Tongue, Singing MI) for durations of 8-20 seconds.

## Objectives

1. **Classification Accuracy**: Determine how accurately long MI-EEG signals can be classified.
2. **Paradigm Comparison**: Compare the performance of continuous versus switch control paradigms in MI-BCI systems.
3. **Participant Preferences**: Investigate which MI tasks participants prefer for long MI-BCI sessions.
4. **Optimal System Design**: Develop an online MI-BCI system that supports participant needs and achieves reliable classification accuracy.
